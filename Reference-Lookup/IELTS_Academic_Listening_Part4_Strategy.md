## 🔧 Technical Implementation Requirements

### Enhanced Audio System (Part 4 Specifications)
- Duration Calculation: `contentDuration + 30000ms` (30-second buffer)
- Speech Rate: 0.75–0.85 for academic clarity
- Pause Integration: 3000ms between segments and after `onend`
- Accent Authenticity: Select voices by region where available
- Error Recovery: Continue to next segment on TTS error
- Non-Interrupting Timer Policy:
  - The timer must never cancel or stop playback.
  - If the timer elapses during playback, defer the auto-submit popup until the audio completes naturally (including pauses).
  - Auto-submit popup should appear immediately after natural completion when the timer has already elapsed.

```javascript
// Part 4 timing
const conversationData = [ /* academic lecture segments */ ];
const contentDuration = conversationData.reduce((sum, seg) => sum + seg.duration, 0);
let totalDuration = contentDuration + 30000; // dynamic: audio (incl. pauses) + 30s buffer

// Voice configuration example
const voiceConfig = {
  'Professor Eleanor Wright': { rate: 0.8, pitch: 1.0, volume: 0.9, lang: 'en-GB' }
};

// Dynamic timer display (on load)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  document.getElementById('totalTime').textContent = formatTime(totalDuration);
});
```

### Authentic IELTS Part 4 Question Format
